This project is at an inception/scoping stage. The main current goal is to acquire as much information as possible about the model, the system and its boundaries in the shortest possible time. We'll handle outliers (like the EtherChaintrade.amount [issue](https://github.com/MiguelPeralvo/etherchainml/issues/5)) or performance considerations in a suboptimal way for the time being as we don't even have a clear scope or requirements for this project.
